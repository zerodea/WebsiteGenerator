Website builder for `zerodea.github.io`. The website is set up, but making changes to it is a pain in the ass because
changes have to be propagated to all pages. So if we add something to the footer it has to be copy-pasted everywhere.

The idea is that we can have the articles written in one place and then the website is generated for those articles.
