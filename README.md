Website builder for `zerodea.github.io`. Writing a website with pure HTML/CSS is a pain in the ass because
changes have to be propagated to all pages. So if we add something to the footer it has to be copy-pasted everywhere.

This project was created to handle the limitations of HTML/CSS. The website is still written in raw HTML/CSS , but
things like the header and footer are copied automatically to each HTML file so I only have to worry about writing
articles and let the generator handle everything else.
